            <h2>OSHI NO KO</h2>
            <p>Oshi no Ko is a wonderful series that follows the same author as Kaguya-sama: Love is War, Aka Akasaka, but in a different format. Oshi no Ko is quite good at making your stomach turn from covering genuine issues that affect the entertainment industry, whereas Kaguya-sama is good at making you laugh, cringe, and root for the young loves. Every Oshi no Ko episode has a fresh plot point and gorgeous animation created by Doga Kobo studio.
